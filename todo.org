  Just take input filenames from the command line. They don't
  have be TIFFs either.
* DONE Do the processing in a temporary directory

  Currently we spam intermediate files all over the current directory
  and don't clean up afterwards. This is bad.
* DONE Allow user to specify output file
  CLOSED: [2017-01-31 Tue 16:32]
  Need to think a little about how to do this.
  Optional argument? First non-optional argument? Last non-optional
  argument? If optional, what's the default? Since we delegate
  to tiff2pdf we could just pass an -o parameter through if it
  exists. If not, tiff2pdf will write to stdout.
* TODO Write a README
* TODO Proper installation via setup.py and entry point
