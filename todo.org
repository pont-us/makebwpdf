* DONE More flexible input
  CLOSED: [2017-01-31 Tue 16:42]
  Just take input filenames from the command line. They don't
  have be TIFFs either.
* DONE Do the processing in a temporary directory
  CLOSED: [2017-01-31 Tue 16:32]
  Currently we spam intermediate files all over the current directory
  and don't clean up afterwards. This is bad.
* DONE Allow user to specify output file
  CLOSED: [2017-01-31 Tue 16:32]
  Need to think a little about how to do this.
  Optional argument? First non-optional argument? Last non-optional
  argument? If optional, what's the default? Since we delegate
  to tiff2pdf we could just pass an -o parameter through if it
  exists. If not, tiff2pdf will write to stdout.
* DONE Write a README
  CLOSED: [2017-01-31 Tue 17:51]
* DONE Refactor process function
  CLOSED: [2020-03-29 Sun 10:26]
  [2020-03-28 Sat] ~process(args, tempdir)~ should be split up.
* TODO Proper installation via setup.py and entry point
* TODO Add option to scan image
  [2020-03-28 Sat] Add an option which acquires a page image directly
  from a scanner rather than having it supplied as a file.
* TODO Add an "append" option
  [2020-03-28 Sat] Add an option to append the output to an existing PDF
  file. Would be particularly useful in conjunction with the planned
  "scan" option.
* DONE Catch subprocess errors
  CLOSED: [2020-03-29 Sun 12:12]
  [2020-03-28 Sat] Currently, exit statuses of subprocesses are not
  checked, so an error at an early stage in the process is likely to
  result in a cascade of other errors as programs try to read non-existent
  files.

  [2020-03-29 Sun] Fixed crudely by replacing calls to subprocess.call
  with subprocess.check_call, which throws an exception if the subprocess
  exits with an non-zero status. The exception is not further handled,
  so makebwpdf terminates with an ugly stack trace, but it's cleaner
  and clearer than blindly ploughing on with the remaining processing
  steps.
* TODO Switch from pdfsandwich to ocrmypdf for OCR?
  [2020-03-29 Sun] ocrmypdf's major advantange (that it doesn't re-encode
  images) doesn't make much difference for makebwpdf, because the PDFs
  only contain bilevel images anyway and pdfsandwich can re-encode them to
  CCITT-4 -- however, I have the impression that ocrmypdf is more capable
  and better maintained overall.
